// ðŸ›  LLM Fix Start
The test is failing because it's expecting a "Success" message, but it's receiving an "Email already registered on the waitlist" error instead. This means that the test is trying to sign up with an email that's already been registered, hence the 409 error (conflict).

To fix the issue, you should either use a unique email for each test run or clear the database before running the test. Here's how you can modify the test to use a unique email:

```typescript
test("should show an error on duplicate sign ups to the waitlist", async ({
  page,
}) => {
  const homePage = new HomePage(page);
  await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
  // Use a unique email for each test run
  const uniqueEmail = `test${Math.random()}@example.com`;
  await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, uniqueEmail, company);
  await homePage.assertToastMessage("Success");
});
```

Additionally, you could create an additional test to specifically check for the "Email already registered on the waitlist" error when trying to sign up with a duplicate email:

```typescript
test("should show an error when trying to sign up with a duplicate email", async ({
  page,
}) => {
  const homePage = new HomePage(page);
  await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
  await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, email, company);
  await homePage.assertToastMessage("Success");
  // Try to sign up again with the same email
  await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
  await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, email, company);
  await homePage.assertToastMessage("Error409: {\"message\":\"Email already registered on the waitlist\"}");
});
```

In this test, we first sign up successfully, then try to sign up again with the same email and check for the error message.
