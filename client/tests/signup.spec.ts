The test is failing because it's expecting a success message when it should be expecting an error message. The test is trying to sign up with the same email twice, which should result in an error message indicating that the email is already registered. The test is failing because it's looking for the text "Success" instead of the error message.

The fix would be to change the assertion to look for the error message instead of the success message. Here's the corrected code:

```typescript
   19:   await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
   20:   await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, email, company);
   21:   await homePage.assertToastMessage("Error409: {\"message\":\"Email already registered on the waitlist\"}");
   22: });
   23: 
  >24: test("should show an error on duplicate sign ups to the waitlist", async ({
   25:   page,
   26: }) => {
   27:   const homePage = new HomePage(page);
   28:   await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
   29:   await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, email, company);
```

In addition to this fix, I'd suggest adding a new test to check for the success message when signing up with a new email. This would help ensure that the success message is displayed correctly when a user signs up with a new email. Here's how that test might look:

```typescript
test("should show a success message on successful sign ups to the waitlist", async ({
   page,
}) => {
   const homePage = new HomePage(page);
   await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
   await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, newEmail, company); // newEmail is a unique email not used before
   await homePage.assertToastMessage("Success");
});
```

  await homePage.clickWaitListButton();
  await homePage.fillOutWaitListForm(fullName, email, company);
  await homePage.assertToastMessage("Success");
});
