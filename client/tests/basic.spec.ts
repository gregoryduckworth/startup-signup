The test is failing because the expected title of the page is "ToBeChanged", but the actual title of the page is "InnovateTech". 

The error is at line 6 where the test is asserting that the title should be "ToBeChanged". Since the actual title of the page is "InnovateTech", the test fails. 

You can fix the test by correcting the expected title to "InnovateTech". 

Here is the corrected code:

```typescript
1: import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
2: 
3: test("basic test", async ({ page }) => {
4:   await page.goto("http://localhost:3000");
5:   const title = await page.title();
6:   expect(title).toBe("InnovateTech");
7: });
8: 
```

Additional Test:
You can also add a test to check if the title changes when a certain action is performed on the page. For example, if clicking a button changes the title, you can test that. 

```typescript
test("title change test", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000");
  await page.click('#change-title-button');
  await page.waitForTimeout(500); // wait for title to change
  const title = await page.title();
  expect(title).toBe("ToBeChanged");
});
```
In this test, we are clicking a button with the id 'change-title-button' and then waiting for the title to change to 'ToBeChanged'.
